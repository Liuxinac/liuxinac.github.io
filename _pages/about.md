<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year PhD student at Imperial College London, supervised by Dr. Tara Mangal and Professor Timothy Hallett.

My research integrates machine learning, modeling, and health, with a particular focus on infectious disease. I have been committed to the prevention and control of infectious diseases, including sexually transmitted infections (HIV, HPV), respiratory infections (COVID-19, tuberculosis), and the screening and control of poliomyelitis. I am also deeply interested in research related to mental health and behavioral medicine.

My recent work centers on infectious disease modeling and explores the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to disease screening and prediction. If you are interested in collaborating or discussing potential projects, please feel free to contact me by email.

I have published 10+ papers at the peer review journal with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ltfSar0AAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>10+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ltfSar0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
